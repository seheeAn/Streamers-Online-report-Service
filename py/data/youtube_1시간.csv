Trisha,4:08,I highly recommend watching the entire video!
Jenny K,4:09,I watched this last night and was so moved.
nodhill,4:13,protests have resulted in rioting but the protests dont equal riots/looting.
Gulfam Ahmed,4:17,hi from India love u
Jayne Lim,4:25,trevor noah is such an intelligent and thoughtful person who expresses himself so well
Miranda Stephens,4:31,@robby robby it is a private charity i believe. it's definitely not a youtube charity
Mel,4:32,I know it’s so hard. My heart has been heavy all week. Love Trevor Noah.
MeghanKat,4:36,I'm in Chicago and these riots are honestly so terrifying
Phyrra Nyx,4:37,Here in Tampa I think the authorities made things go violent

Reen Campbell,5:31,"NOA.... in my city, they are riots..started in protest, ended in riots"
Phyrra Nyx,5:32,@OmniBlast so glad you love them!
Mary Dixon,5:37,Anti-fascist is good. It is American. It is what the good guys are in every movie or tv show you have ever seen.
Gulfam Ahmed,5:46,my question is why girls were short clothing is there are disrespecting there religion what?
Cosmic Slice,5:47,"When Sandra Bland died it spurred Malcolm Gladwell to write his new book ""Talking to Strangers"". It really is a must read."
Robby Robby,5:48,I mean the decision that it's not a charity is that YouTube saying they don't recognize it as a charity or is it the government saying they don't recognize it as a charity
lesley henry,5:50,"We have to use our voice to speak out, educate ourselves by listening to our black brothers and sisters, pray for guidance, always look for the good in others and love unconditionally."
Maria D,5:51,🙏💕
Tracie 3,5:52,There is a big difference between Protesting to bring awareness peacefully and Rioting which definitely is defeating the purpose of those trying to get their message across peacefully..
GingerJeanie,5:58,"I watched the entire video from Trevor Noah, and it was so good. He expressed emotion with intelligence and self-control, which makes it so effective."
COLLEEN KESSLER RN,5:59,Trevor is awesome
Noa Shaindlinger,6:00,Reen - the police are rioting. Not the people.
Gen Giovannone,6:03,"I agree there's no ""right"" way to protest. you just never want to see violence of any kind."
Tinytitan50,6:06,@ Nola protests doesn’t mean to destroy what is not yours.
ericabarbz,6:06,There were “opportunist” creating havoc amongst the protesters
Angela Curry,6:13,"Why can't we just love each other , since we can't we can lead with Love and Justice and use our voices for others are can't be heard"
Jenny K,6:16,I'm hearing more and more that the actual protesters are NOT the ones looting and burning.
Michael Diamond,6:21,why is YouTube become a negative hell hole when so many people come to be happy?
Luanne Santos,6:23,"The cops in New Jersey are walking with the protesters. They have signs, brought water and food for everyone"
Mayra L,6:36,The ending of that clip was better in terms of explaining the reason for the riots
Phyrra Nyx,6:37,Riot is the language of the unheard.
Angela Curry,6:39,"Ignore the looting , its the murder that we need to pay attention to"
mariecm,6:41,The people who are looting aren't protesters
Glass Caedmon,6:41,"All of this is heartbreaking. I’m protesting Tuesday. Down here, the people looting are using this as an opportunity and aren’t even protesting in the designated areas"
Tinytitan50,6:46,Sorry now
ALXSSA,6:46,A lot of the people looting and rioting are not black. Remember that.
Noa Shaindlinger,6:47,looting and vandalizing are political acts. Weapons of the weak against the powerful.
Kimber Corbitt,6:57,Peaceful protests have not worked...ie nfl kneeling
ThisIsMeMorgan,6:57,These people are also being egged on by police
Tara Breeden,7:04,I'm more of a hippie lol I just want love why can't everyone get along?
Reen Campbell,7:04,NOA... I was there.... they were screaming “shoot the white person” as they burned people’s homes. People were stabbed...
Debbie Shuta,7:11,There will be ppl that take advantage of chaos. But there is a real injustice here.
Chris Leeds,7:14,destruction is never good but I 100% understand why this is happening
Wendy Horvath,7:14,Good morning ☀️ Jen
Phyrra Nyx,7:19,Support the people. Listen. Be teachable.
Mary Dixon,7:20,The people who are looting and being violent are being spurred by the boogalo/igloo/luau freaks
Miranda Stephens,7:23,i wish people could just do peaceful protesting... I am not poc so I cant say it is wrong how they're doing it but I just wish we could go about this peacefully...
mariecm,7:23,There's actual protests going on alongside the looting they're calling them all riots to convince us there's no reason to protest
Paula Kauffman,7:24,"We have had the Civil Rights Movement, why must we repeat the cycle?!?"
OmniBlast,7:28,"I'm just so saddened by everything going on. We are all connected. The sooner will realize that, the better this world will be. I love everyone, my heart goes out to everybody. Spread peace"
Jill J,7:29,There were white supremecists handing out leaflets in Dayton during the protests.
Crystal Rapose,7:29,"we had a peaceful protest in our city, I'm sure the business owners were scared seeing what happened in many other cities. I'm proud that my neighbor's were respectful"
Jannelle Moreno,7:30,when your looting your own community that's not justice..
Tracie 3,7:32,Rioting causes more fear...
Marti Hurford,7:38,"Jen, did you hear what the Mayor of Atlanta say? Very Powerful."
LaNae Reinertsen,7:40,Exactly Jen. This isn't the first time we've had rioting due to racial injustice
Glass Caedmon,7:40,I’m doing what I can and supporting people around me. We can peacefully protest and vote
Noa Shaindlinger,7:42,"the real looters are the corporations and the rich, not the people who go into a taregt to grab pillows."
misssssshell,7:42,Collective Brain Elite에 오신 것을 환영합니다
K M,7:43,it's all because of those 4 people causing the death of a man. if only cheeto boy think well and stop the ignorance. people protesting because they're hurt.
Angie Rice,7:43,change will never happen under this administration
Maria D,7:47,I agree. This continues to go round and round. This needs to stop. These officers need to be held accountable. 😔
Melissa Pellegrin,7:48,Good morning
Tinytitan50,7:52,Darn autocorrect... Noa
Trashley Fellers,7:52,"in Mpls/St.Paul, they have confirmed a majority of ""looting"" arrests have tied to white supremacists groups & organized crime"
Home Team,7:53,"I don’t blame them one bit at all, I think also keeping the country locked down for 3 months has added to people anger and frustration. Enough is enough of racism and of being locked up"
Angela Curry,7:57,Listen and try to help where you can
Heather Rubino,8:03,"As white women we have the duty right now, IMO, to make the change... we have iNFLUENCE"
Phyrra Nyx,8:03,"people tried peaceful protesting, the cops shot at them with rubber bullets, they sprayed pepper spray on kids, they drove a car into people"
Briana Schino,8:04,Morning! I was watching your other video but I’m here now
AD,8:09,"Sadly, but peacful protests doesn't help. It's so so sad,"
Temitime_faces,8:10,"Guys stop making excuses for the looting, yes many of the real protesters are gaianst looting and the rioting but the people looting and rioting are of all races. They don’t care about the cause,"
Tiffany PK,8:11,There are factions that would see us all destroyed and will use this as an opportunity to garner more hate on both sides. Resist that.
Monika luvs beauty420,8:11,"there is a difference between rioting and protesting. almost all of this started as protests, are ending in horrible sad dangerous rioting, how does that help??"
tina,8:17,the police are instigating alot of the violence.
Home Team,8:19,Good morning
Temitime_faces,8:20,They are just opportunist.
Home Team,8:23,Good morning
Wendy Horvath,8:26,688 watching and only 74 💙👍🏻
Mags M,8:26,I understand I will never understand but I stand.
Mariah Beverage,8:30,I hope people are actually listening now.
Melissa Fallenstein,8:39,There is a quote from Benjamin Franklin that is something like... change cant happen until the ineffective are as mad as the effective
misssssshell,8:42,<3
Angela Curry,8:43,We need to focus this chat on something joyful that brings us all together
Elaine Bines,8:44,hi mods and guys
Jeanna*Gina* Sewell,8:51,"my opinion and I am allowed, we can agree to disagree, burning down your community is wrong. you are hurting the people that live in your community, their livelihoods."
Monika luvs beauty420,8:56,not all officers are making this worse.
K M,9:06,i have friends got hurt for peaceful protestants. the cops threw tear gas and used batons. for what?
Miranda Stephens,9:07,I think we should try to have a mostly light chat today. its going to be hard but i hope we all can have an hour where we can just have fun
Alina N,9:09,We’ve abandoned the core issue...it’s time for people from all sides to sit down and figure out how this can be fixed.
Jenny K,9:11,Here's the thing... peacefully protesting never seems to make a significant change. You have to scream in this country to be heard
GingerJeanie,9:12,"@Melissa Fallenstein, good quote!"
Trashley Fellers,9:14,most protesters WERE peaceful. many of the worst agitators in Mpls are White Supremacists!
Maria D,9:17,"But these protests always happen and things aren’t changing. So, I can understand why all this anger is coming from."
Robyn,9:18,Is it ok to ask where Tati is? Is it ok if I go off topic
Crystal Rapose,9:18,looting and destruction of businesses invalidated any message the protests are trying to get across
Anna Harper,9:21,I live in Minneapolis. The riots aren’t from the protestors anymore. Palettes of bricks are showing up around town. This is organized now to discredit the protests
Phyrra Nyx,9:23,Because people of color are still being murdered.
Michael Diamond,9:25,YouTube is hell now the world has always been dark it’s not just right now
Melanie Scott,9:26,how is this still happening in 2020!??! more love - less hate
JuliaGoes,9:28,“Riots are the voice of the unheard? So what has America failed to hear?” -MLK jr.
Mayra L,9:29,"The societal contract is not respected and is broken for black people. So if you see the riots as difficult to see, imagine seeing the injustice occur to black people as a BLACK PERSON."
tina,9:35,riots are the language of the unheard. Martin Luther King Jr said that....
inkuspm,9:36,"Grief, anger and the murder can cause people to rebel. They are in a blind rage. Consider the emotional impulse. i don't condone but understand. Like if a car is on your child, you somehow lift it.💗"
Mags M,9:37,I understand I will never understand but I stand.
Pretty Accountant,9:39,I need everyone to keep this energy and vote in November.
greeneyes92061,9:40,I know this is a big issue for everyone involved. Came here this morning to hear about makeup and the makeup industry....
Shannon Weisse,9:40,"Morning! I can’t stay on long today, but my family and I have been discussing this issue and we have had some great conversations."
Tianna Ouellette,9:44,"I agree there is no right way to protest, thank you for opening the chat up for everyone to talk"
A.K. C.,9:45,"It’s easy to say we are all connected, but we aren’t all TREATED the same, that’s the problem."
Briana Schino,9:47,Theres been a lot of speculation on Tati
Home Team,9:48,I don not blame the people doing those things one bit
K. Jefferson,9:51,"Hello from San Antonio Texas, the protest here yesterday started off with prayer and was peaceful until late last night out of oft owners came in and began destroying property."
Monika luvs beauty420,9:52,target stores are closing temporarily because of this
Makeup with Mia,9:53,if only people cared as much about human life as they do about a Target store.
Melissa Pellegrin,9:53,Dallas had riots and one man was kicked and stoned
JenUnboxed,9:57,"My initial thoughts on this of ""oh no, I can't believe this is happening again"" is an extension of my white privilege. I saw it as something happening again, but the reality is, it never stopped."
Graciela,9:57,"Jen, you have such wisdom"
Giulia Blue,10:03,"Property can be repaired, human lives can't. I think if that's what it takes to be heard, then that's what it takes."
Heather Rubino,10:04,"We need to, as white women, influence other white women..."
Monika luvs beauty420,10:05,BUT burning and rioting???
Gina Marie Conway,10:08,I remember the Freddie gray riots 😢 seems like that was just yesterday
Michael Diamond,10:09,the lockdown really got to that cop honestly
Mel,10:09,I’ve been hearing peaceful protestors are being assaulted by police. Looters are taking advantage of the situation. Destroying the efforts of a peaceful protest. police brutality needs to stop! Now!
Mayra L,10:10,The end of the Trevor Noah clip explains it better.
Ameerah Muhammad,10:10,Buildings can be rebuilt. The black lives lost cannot. And it’s telling how many people are more outraged about PROPERTY than they are about LIVES.
Nikki Crayons,10:12,oh im only 10 min late!
Noa Shaindlinger,10:12,"Nike is not ""your own community"""
Jessica Seyfried,10:12,"@nerdlingful If you’re here, I missed you guys Friday 🦈"
Wendy Horvath,10:16,What good is it to destroy your own city .
Debbie Hart,10:18,BEAUTIFUL JEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is frightening... we need PEACE & LOVE in this new Rona world!!!!!!!!!! 🌎 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥰
Mary Dixon,10:19,yep they are there
Bakery Mafia,10:21,i agree with Giulia Blue
Ashley l,10:25,I just wish the riots weren't in their neighborhoods.... minorities are employed by these places
Jessica Rodriguez,10:28,"Miami started peacefully.. then it turned into chaos and people vandalizing , stealing etc."
Phyrra Nyx,10:32,The looting is justified. The Target refused to sell supplies to the peaceful protestors who were sprayed with pepper spray
nodhill,10:32,Who is doing the looting? We dont really dont know....
ThisIsMeMorgan,10:33,“A riot is the language of the unheard” -MLK
nerdlingful,10:37,Hi Jess. We missed you too
Debbie Shuta,10:37,There is also this element of suffering due to corona and so ppl are already coming from a place of hurt
Trashley Fellers,10:38,businesses are insured. they can rebuild. you can't bring someone back to life
mariecm,10:39,looting is happening ALONGSIDE protests...they aren't the same thing: 2 diff groups of pple doing these things

Rose Schumaker,10:46,the looters are not locals. this happened before when there was looting here in Oaklamd.
Elizabeth Lee Goodman,10:46,I live in Memphis. We've had four nights of peaceful protests. I'm very proud of my city.
ChloeTKMakeup,10:52,From what I’ve seen online a lot of the looting is coming from white opportunists rather than black individuals - people need to watch who they are blaming
Gina Marie Conway,10:55,They tried peaceful protesting. They got scrutinized for taking a knee so how are they supposed to get people to hear them?

Erin McManaway,11:45,We have to look at the broader context as to why this is happening. Riots also seem to be the catalyst for change such as the Stonewall riots and the Boston Tea Party

Starla822,12:07,good morning Jen
Shannon Quinn,12:09,"I can't blame them. They've been speaking nicely, protesting peacefully, yelling, even screaming, and it didn't change things. People kneeled at a football game & people lost their ever-loving minds"
Teresa Niswander,12:10,My heart just hurts due to current situation.
AD,12:13,Let's talk about Kyle Jenner lying about being too rich lol

Brunhilde Eihwaz,13:45,"I am so glad you’re talking about this, Jen. ❤️"
Miranda Stephens,13:47,@nikki grace she only said it cuz she was saying what the president said... she wasnt calling them thugs herself
Eliane A,13:47,Trump is the biggest thug of them all
Steven Lopez,13:49,It’s just hard. Because when they protest peacefully they are met with rubber bullets and tear gas.

zoe asf,14:05,the protests were peaceful until the cops cames

Tiffany PK,14:53,"Othering words are problematic! “Their” seems to mean that these are not also your problems. That you would sit back, judge from afar, and just look on. How lucky you are to have a choice."
Ana Co,14:55,What happened to Tati?
LaNae Reinertsen,14:58,People need to stop saying 'those people are from out of town'. They arent. Its rage and frustration across the county.
Shontelle Watson,14:58,Hello
Tracy Sansotta,15:01,The looters are not the peaceful protests. People are coming from other cities and states to take advantage. People pls vote in all your local state and in November!!

Angeline,16:00,wait there's a i csnt breath look

JayJay,16:04,"Let me first say that I am a minority. If you hurt the innocent you are a thug! White, black, Hispanic...it matters not. Hurting the innocent is never the answer."
Angeline,16:09,terrible idea.

Lycia Tomlinson,16:30,"Black people are killed by police who are not properly prosecuted for the murders they commit for years, but since this administration has come into office, the violence has escalated exponentially."
Grace Adams,16:31,Do you think it’s ignorant if beauty gurus don’t speak up on this? Or do you think they’re not speaking up because they don’t want to say the wrong thing?
Shannon Quinn,16:32,"We white people need to SUPPORT our black sisters and brothers, raise THEIR voices, NOT speak for or over them. None of us are perfect and we need to look inside & change our own behaviour too."

Tonja Watts,16:55,We had a police issue a few days after me
Jaime K.,17:01,You just reach a point where you can't take it anymore. At what point will this country recognize that our lives have value? What will it take to not live in fear every day?
patricia holland,17:01,it is hard to have people think correctly when the president can you be racist to but this goes down to the blind rage that people are feeling and lashing out at anyone they feel pain and anger
Cosmic Slice,17:03,I can't blame anyone for taking a social media break right now. All I'm doing is posting my subscription boxes to Instagram

Gina Petti,17:44,"I think that is being debunked, but whether it is or it isn't, justice is more important than tranquility"
ThisIsMeMorgan,17:49,Polly pocket if you want to relax this might not be the right place for you today
Jessica Barone,17:52,"for ppl asking to talk about makeup, Tati, Kylie not a billionaire, this is what is meant by privilege. you get to not be afraid, you are looking for something else when millions can't."

Rachel Timmerman,18:13,Yes - Serial was awesome!
ClassicallyDiana,18:20,"I used to be the one saying looting is not the way to do things. My perspective has changed. Human Lives are being lost, let’s refocus on that. No matter how upsetting, material things can be replaced"

Sandra M. D.,19:04,Jennifer Ruiz nope!
PeachyKyna,19:07,Please remove the correlation between the looters and the protesters. Many protesters are NOT looting. The looters are taking advantage of the situation.

Machteld Sofia,20:15,yes @Phyrra Nyx
Jennifer Giaramita,20:18,The police did that here in Phoenix. They came out and talked to the protesters and most supported.
Fritz McBride,20:19,Good cops NEED to speak up! They need to be allies!

PeachyKyna,21:06,@Nikki Grace all love and respect ✊
Pretty Distracted Nails,21:09,there are agitators looting & setting fires & escalating events not protestors. There are white separatist groups that have infiltrated our police departments according to the FBI reports.

Sandy P,22:14,"My mother died at age 91 over 3 years ago. I am over age 50 and I’ve heard all my life that change takes time. The frustration comes from wondering, how long should this change take?"
Mary Dixon,22:15,because riots are right? Why walk out if a priest gives a positive message?
Aphreyst,22:16,it's not anti-police to advocate for more training and transparency for police officers. it would help them and the public.
A.K. C.,22:21,The fact someone of a certain race commits a crime doesn’t mean the ENTIRE race gets to be dehumanized and killed by cops.

sandy5791,22:43,I'm here just listening.
PeachyKyna,22:45,I talked to an actual good cop yesterday and he said his station had an emergency meeting and they all discussed why it's wrong for them to 1) use excessive force and 2) escalate against protesters
Deanna W,22:48,What these rioters fail to realize is that they are taking away from the message of the protests which have been peaceful.
Unapologetically Mocha,22:52,"And that’s black man should have been arrested, tried and if convicted, jailed. But what does have to do with a racist cop kneeling on a black MSN’s neck until he died?"

Jennifer Gould,23:09,"Jen, we are having a chat about it. That's how we are getting through it."
Katie Stevens,23:09,Thank you for shutting down the comments from individuals who want to delegitimize these protests.
Shontelle Watson,23:12,People don’t feel safe. People don’t feel heard. What difference does it make if they can’t go to a restaurant they didn’t feel safe driving to without being harassed by the police?
Mark Ferchland,23:13,You are a voice of reason
Mel,23:14,I don’t necessarily want to switch topics... this has been heavy on my heart. But thinking about Tati’s Instagram post. It reminds me of all the hate in the world.... makes my heart hurt!

Luanne Santos,23:17,My comments aren’t posting. I keep losing the chat.
Tracie 3,23:22,I don’t want children to fear all police officers.. I think many cops take the oath to protect and shouldn’t be grouped with the bad cops that took the oath for “power”..
Averia Gaskin,23:28,Yes caryn let’s talk about those fools writing I can’t breathe on their faces!
Marisa Irven,23:30,I feel like they shouldnt hire as cops if they have any racist background and maybe racism should be grounds for termination Bc then their ability to help the general public becomes biased and unfair
Aisha Khalil,23:32,But we see tgis over and over again blue protects blue

Anna Putnam,23:43,The New World Order is being rushed in. Everything is falling in place according to plan and the next step is martial law using these Riots as an Excuse.
Phyrra Nyx,23:44,police need to stop being trained that civilians are the enemy.
Julie Lute,23:45,"Can I ask, how has covid 19 effected POC more greatly? I truly want to understand"
Tiffany PK,23:45,"Jen, I appreciate you tackling the topic. I know it’s not easy."
Bridget Bentley,23:46,I got blocked because I called out an Influencer talking about the riots over George

Leesa Wallace,24:27,"I live in Kansas City and there was rioting here last night. I believe the officer should be held accountable but, rioting is not the answer."
Makeup Junky,24:29,@jennifer Ruiz. Police brutality is demeaning to ALL lives. The focus needs to be an overhaul of our entire justice system across the board. We need everyone to raise their voices. Not just Blacks.

Monika luvs beauty420,24:30,@Noa.. no good police????
emysupernova,24:30,I'm a Black woman in Canada and I'm glad you are talking about it today. People don't tend to understand what loothing deeply represents. People are underprivileged and discriminated against.

Katie Stevens,24:42,Talk about your student.
Monz,24:43,Lack of training?! Are you kidding Robby Robby?! He couldn’t BREATHE and said this. The cop committed manslaughter.
Jaime K.,24:43,"My mom grew up in segregation in Miami. I spoke to her yesterday and she was in tears, trying to figure out why this is still happening. Why is this still our reality? Why can't we be treated equally?"
Julie,24:45,I was encouraged to see so many Beauty influencers that posted support and or are donating AdSense
EnchantedWings,24:46,The officer who killed George had many previous counts of use of unnecessary force. I wonder why he wasn't fired before this...

Ameerah Muhammad,24:56,Im frankly tired of people who have not experienced this what THEY think is the best way to handle it. Because its clear that no matter how we protest it’s never the “right” way.
Lycia Tomlinson,24:56,@Sandy P I'm 54- how long should we wait for change has been my question from the beginning.

Miranda Stephens,25:31,what theyre putting it into makeup??? wtf?
Sandra M. D.,25:33,Thank you! @makeup junky
Sandra,25:36,I personally think all cops should see a therapist at least once a month. we never know what kind of day/night they've had prior to work. That doesn't excuse these cops by any means.
Mayra L,25:37,Yes @atbhprincess
Jaime K.,25:40,I saw that @Sharron. London too
Sussex Sandra,25:42,the majority of your audience may think it’s ok for the police to do what they did. think about the confidence Amy Cooper had in threatening the African American male. It’s accepted White Privilege.
Holly Kirklighter,25:49,opinions on the brands not making any statements?? makeup specifically
ALXSSA,25:54,"@atbprincess Exactly, people really gaslight all the time when black people speak up!"

Sharron G,26:21,"Yes, and London too!"
squeakco,26:21,Prosecuting murderers would be a first step. George Floyd was murdered without a doubt and cops will keep on killing if there is no consequence!
Dannielle Obenchain,26:23,It's not freezing on my end leave and come back it will fix usually

Angeline,26:34,make sure where you donate is reputable. so many scams now a days
EnchantedWings,26:36,"+abtprincess you shouldn't be. We, as a makeup community, believe you and love you."
Talestra,26:38,"All I keep thinking is, if someone harmed someone I cared for, whose ass wouldn't I set on fire until justice is done?"
Andrea Davis,26:40,Looting and stealing punishes innocent people. It does nothing to punish the ones committing these acts.
SuperSassyS,26:40,Training is only the tip of the iceberg. People have to uncover their own bias and be aware of them as they bring them to their jobs
Shanti Mattie,26:43,In line at TJ Maxx yesterday people just wanted to talk about my makeup. They needed the distraction.
Anna Harper,26:45,The Minneapolis police are no longer following their training. They are not supposed to be arresting press. They are not supposed to shoot rubber bullets at people’s heads. They don’t care anymore
Erin Yost,26:46,has anyone tried the new Charlotte tillbury bronzers?? really thinking about it!💜💜
K M,26:46,I actually surprised that jeffree starr talked about the late Mr
Marisa Irven,26:47,They are t helping anyway if they have a racist bone In their body
Miranda Stephens,26:48,yes jen that is what im doing. i cannot donate to the charities but i am spreading the word and the hashtags etc on my social medias
saucerjess,26:49,"@Sandra agreed. Therapy is good for everyone, but we shun it in our society for some stupid reason :("
MamaGoony,26:53,We are going through a complicated time right now
atbprincess,26:55,"Or thinking that one's own personal wants (i.e., wanting to see makeup content) are more important the human rights issue at hand. Privilege and entitlement."
Sussex Sandra,26:57,The whole situation was reported on UK news.
Lori Hikiji,26:59,This situation makes me sad and angry as an officer's wife as well. He and many are good officers who have dedicated their lives to serve and protect others by putting their lives on the line daily.
Noa Shaindlinger,27:02,maybe cops shouldn't be out in full riot gear
Renee Lahue,27:05,Yes that’s wrong
HK_ Nurse,27:07,The chat keeps freezing for me.
Tracey's Fashion Outlook,27:08,I'm in my car coming home from work and always get followed a couple of blocks from Police and I'm just going home to relax and unwind and watch some YouTube but they see a POC and here we go.
JuliaGoes,27:16,"Police officers went on strike in NYC and crime actually went down, there was a whole study on it and a paper written"
Phyrra Nyx,27:18,cops shouldn't be shooting bullets and pepper spray at the crowds
JayJay,27:20,The only thing that is going to stop racist officers is non-racist officers. They need to speak up when they see the behavior
Ameerah Muhammad,27:23,@K M he talked about it AFTER he was called out by Jackie Aina
Mel,27:24,We also need to get out and vote to make change! This election year is more important than ever! Not including our senate and congress!
Christina McGinnis,27:25,agree wholeheartedly
Brandi Rose,27:26,"Trying to explain to my 11 and 7 year old, who don't see color, only people, that we shouldn't have to fear the police, is heartbreaking"
Averia Gaskin,27:27,"I am tired of people outside our black community telling us how to walk, talk, breathe, live and what is best for our lives and community"
Scottilicious McFabulous,27:28,Exactly!! Peaceful doesnt seem to do anything. Its friggin sad..
Nikki Crayons,27:30,kapernick was peaceful....
Unapologetically Mocha,27:31,The bright side to all this is that more people are standing up and speaking out. That’s the only thing keeping me sane.
inkuspm,27:31,There are so many honorable officers. There are also bad ones.
Jessica T,27:33,People just want to be heard
Ahhchilee,27:34,Anonymous was hacking the PD and found some very unsightly things about hidden murders done and human trafficking that was covered up. Everything coming to light now makes it so scary to go outside
ALXSSA,27:34,Peaceful does nothing but looting does nothing too.
Machteld Sofia,27:34,"People have had enough of doing things peacefully, since nobody seems to listen. Result? riots"
Holly Kirklighter,27:37,again I saw this 28 years ago with Rodney king riots
Karen Smith,27:42,reports have been that the fires that were started by undercover police so they could justify calling in national guard and using more force.
stacy echelberger,27:46,Non-peaceful hasn’t worked either. Rodney King?
Shirley,27:51,My father was a NYS deputy sheriff I lived with the penal book on the dining room table. He lived by those rules & died by them. Not all have the same values.
Sarah Tsou,27:53,"peaceful doesn't work, so let's kill more innocent people? these riots arent safe for anyone."
Jessie Reed-Pautz,27:55,i think people feel so helpless that they dont know what to do because nothings working so they are rioting
Enjera Black,27:55,What do you think about people saying it’s actually cops that are starting the riots.
Norunn Ladstein,27:57,I feel so sad and sorry for all these riots in the US. Lots of love to all of you from a compassionate Soul in Norway. ❤️
Miranda Stephens,27:58,agreed phyrra nyx
Julie Lute,27:58,"Tiffany, thank you. I understand that to be an issue"
Monz,28:01,I reached out to my black friend to inquire what I can do help. He kindly advised me to start with conversation - watch the Netflix documentary “13th”. Listen learn talk donate if you can
Marti Hurford,28:02,"Police have a very strong, influential union. They need to come out and speak. Because most times the police won’t do anything without the blessing of the union. IMHO."
Deanna W,28:03,What I’m getting at is(at least in my city) is the rioters are even the same group as the protesters. It’s a completely different group of people taking advantage of the situation.
Marvalous,28:04,This was heart wrenching to watch. So cruel
Shontelle Watson,28:04,That fact they needed to have discussion on why it’s wrong to use excessive force speaks the problem
Sharron G,28:07,The police department being burned down is the only unpeaceful act I agree with. They refused to arrest the cop. Enraging!
Melinda Clark,28:10,Violence begets violence. I’m afraid the protests will be used as an excuse to escalate in those communities. No right answer.
Julie,28:11,not only that a lot of the worst things that happen work from outsiders who wanted to escalate things. To make the black lives matter protesters look bad
Ameerah Muhammad,28:12,Black folks have been “peacefully protesting” for DECADES. Colin Kaepernick peacefully protested and lost his entire career for it
inkuspm,28:18,The other 2 should be charged too and the lookout.
Jennifer Ruiz,28:19,@Shontelle Watson exactly my sentiment
ChloeTKMakeup,28:19,I was at “peaceful” protests 20 years ago as a baby and I’m 23 ow and nothing has changed
ALXSSA,28:22,They need to raise the degree. He had an intent to kill George Floyd.
manderjack,28:22,"why do so many people get mad when others say ""all lives matter""?"
Machteld Sofia,28:22,@Ahhchilee I saw that.
Tiffany PK,28:28,"That’s the point, people who are not there for the cause being destructive. To distract & manipulate the situation."
Briana Schino,28:33,"He can’t be charged with first degree, it wasn’t premeditated that we know of and he wasn’t lying in wait"
dioneculbert,28:36,"Tell me when ""peaceful protest has ever worked"""
Lauren Langlois,28:36,The oppressed will never win their freedom by appealing to the moral sensibilities of their oppressors
Mayra L,28:37,The Netflix documentary 13th. Watch it.
Tinytitan50,28:38,All the officers involved... standing by should be charged with something!
AngelSKitCat,28:39,THEY ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO GET A CONVICTION!!! and they made the arrest very quickly.
Angeline,28:40,I feel like they're doing the burn it to the ground a d start over but they're burning the wrong buildings
Honey Beckstoffer,28:46,Police officers are penalized for coming forward and reporting their own. That needs to change. Reporting racism in a police brotherhood needs to be protected and rewarded.
nerdlingful,28:47,"@robby Robby, I will not accept your instigating any longer. stop now."
Nikki Crayons,28:48,kapernick was peaceful..
Shirley,28:52,I love you Jen 💗🤗💗 this is a tough chat xoxo
Julie,28:55,"well everybody’s paying attention now, that’s some thing"
Happy Alyssa29,28:56,I am not saying do not donate but please read the wording of the Go fund me George's brother set up. It has some unusual statements which seem to indicate the bulk of the money wont go to his children
Angeline,28:56,I'm trying to.word it right
Shanti Mattie,28:57,The most impactful protest I’ve seen this time around is when everyone took a knee in the middle of the street.
Jen Fangirl,28:58,John Oliver did a great piece on Police Accountability a few years ago that was eye opening. It's on his YouTube channel.
Maria Pullas,29:00,"Stonewall was a 5 day riot, but keep saying riots and lootings don’t change anything"
Gen Giovannone,29:03,@mayra ty for the recommendation
Monz,29:03,I reached out to my black friend Dan. He kindly advised me what I can do to help ❤️
Jennifer Ruiz,29:04,100% thanks @Phyrra Nyx because some people are being highly offensive to their thoughts.. showing how privilege really works and are hurtful
Vivi Crespo,29:05,Peaceful protest doesn’t work anymore.
Scottilicious McFabulous,29:06,Looting is apart of the revolt.
Jackie C,29:07,"If this doesn't make anything change, idk what will. This country needs to wake up."
Graciela,29:08,"We looted this country, and us has looted everything it currently has"
Heather Rubino,29:09,I believe that we as white women possess the authority to influence in our communities to effect change
Jannelle Moreno,29:09,there have been some awesome protests but the media just shows the violent ones.
Talestra,29:09,I'm tired of seeing people try to justify him kneeling on a person's neck for 8 minutes. while he's cuffed!
Mary Dixon,29:10,"""all Lives matter"" was a sarcastic answer to 'black lives matter' and picked up by right wing media"
Unapologetically Mocha,29:12,Question: have people not figured out that the violent protesters are trying to change the narrative? They’re the infiltrators.
Dani Eileen,29:12,"Burning down building is a big no for me, these people have jobs and you’re taking them away!"
Ursula TheAwesome,29:21,US had 8 years of a poc president. nothing has changed s
Miranda Stephens,29:22,agreed phyrra nyx. i used to say it thinking that it meant good but once i realized it I didnt say that again
ChloeTKMakeup,29:22,Been protesting all my life - I’m not that old only 23 but in the last 20 years I’ve seen no change. The only change is that its being videoed and tweeted about.
Home Team,29:24,this county was at a boiling point already bc of the lock down orders so I think this tipped people over the edge
Lycia Tomlinson,29:27,Riot gear against megaphones? How is that a balance?
HK_ Nurse,29:36,There were protests in NYC which I believe opened the Eric Garner wound for us. This is a direct copy-cat situation.
Cosmic Slice,29:37,Nothing has changed after all the previous deaths...nothing will change after this one either I'm afraid.
Makeup Junky,29:39,"@jennifer Ruiz you do realize I am a Black woman. I doubt if your perspective is as deep as mine. You had to tell me you are a POC, you can see I am a POC."
Valentine Lissar,29:39,I feel like looting targets the wrong people and creates race tensions between groups. EX people are looting primarily shops and stores downtown it's making everything worse.
Julie,29:42,No societal change comes without upheaval that’s just history
ClassicallyDiana,29:46,"There was a protest in Flint Michigan, and the Police Officers joined the protesters. The Sheriff said “We’re Mad Too! What can we do?” And the crowd responded “Join Us”."
Jennifer Ruiz,29:49,when black and brown are peaceful and silent nothing changes.. when we act out and speak loudly we are heard.. its all systemic
maricella888,29:49,"Vote, vote, vote and then hold politicians accountable locally and nationally. We all have to take action because inaction is unacceptable."
Makeup with Mia,29:50,I'm a law student. I think the charge should be higher.
Colleen T,29:51,From my dad “The police and public officials enjoy what is called Qualified Immunity. Granted by the Supreme Court. It protects them when they screw up” Retired police officer disgusted by all of this
Erin McManaway,29:53,Watch the Netflix documentary 13th if you have the time! It does an awesome in depth look at the policing and jailing of black bodies
Sussex Sandra,29:53,I have been pleased to see that all colours are protesting and not just block people.
Brandi Rose,29:57,"Trying to explain to my 11 and 7 year old, who see people, not color, that we shouldn't have to be scared of the police is a heartbreaking conversation."
Emme Juliana,29:58,@Phyrra Nyx Appreciate your voice 110%
Ahhchilee,30:02,The world needs to change and 2020 is that year. So much has happened and it’s to late to stop now
Maggie Sugar,30:02,Hi everyoneee!!
Mel,30:04,My chat keeps freezing
Tiffany PK,30:04,@LaurenLanglois exactly true. You can’t expect a whole lot from a society that has tried to keep you down.
Phyrra Nyx,30:06,"Look, without the Stonewall Riots, which were really violent, and led by people of color, we would not have LGBTQIA rights, this is important"
Monz,30:06,Thanks Jen Luvs Reviews for speaking about this
Gen Giovannone,30:11,this is the conversation we need
ana puentes,30:12,"I think an obligated read right now, especially for white or visually white people, is “Me and white supremacy”, it even has exercises to make change a reality."
nodhill,30:12,You have to wonder how different this would all be with a national leader...
Angelea Asbury,30:15,Football is not the right place for protest. He could have made a positive movement outside of his job
Sylvia Rachel,30:15,"youre providing and holding space for this conversation, and I commend you for that. We all need to hold space and recognize our positions and our responsibilities as citizens"
Cosmic Slice,30:16,Another really good book for understanding America is Bunk by Kevin Young
Sophia MacFarlane,30:18,"I've lived with racism, but as an Asian American.....when I moved to Maine as a child, if you were anything but white you were different & picked on. my daughter is half Korean & a POC"
Averia Gaskin,30:21,Let’s talk about luxury makeup. I am tired of color pop.
Lycia Tomlinson,30:24,@Cosmic Slice I agree. Same as always.
Jessica T,30:26,We need to change the way we talk to our children about race. It'll take generations of change to see it in how society behaves.
IndigobluBeauty,30:27,@unapologetically mocha I’ve been trying to say this! That’s exactly what is going on. I’m here in Minneapolis St Paul area
Jillie's Nails,30:28,Do you know anything about cherry oil? I saw it in a nail
Ursula TheAwesome,30:32,8 years of Poc president and nothing has changed. 4 years of this one and also no change. Garbage system indeed.
Justine Couture,30:32,just in. Hi Jen!
Teresa Niswander,30:33,I would appreciate if anyone can tell me about their experiences as a black person - I really want to learn and understand from your point of view
nerdlingful,30:34,"@robby Robby Every week you come in here and you poke the bear constantly. Every single week. I will not except this from you any longer, or your fake acting innocent. This is your final warning"
Meg B,30:34,My boyfriend and I just keep talking about the riots from the Rodney King murder in 1992.
misssssshell,30:35,you do look very pretty today
Machteld Sofia,30:36,@Phyrra Nyx thank you for sharing your knowledge
Connie,30:37,cosas means things in spanish
Jennifer Ruiz,30:38,@Makeup Junky i truly dont care that i had to say it.. i know what people assume me to be and i know my blood and roots.. thats perfectly fine.. theres people who are advocate and against..
Valentine Lissar,30:39,I feel like the protesting would be better served if they created specific things they wanted things to be changed otherwise it's hard for us to see real change
Colleen T,30:43,YouTube has been having issues with freezing in live chat lately
Happy Alyssa29,30:44,For the make up break i am using my good ol Queen of Hearts from Coloured Raine
Mary Dixon,30:45,watch old episodes of 'Cops' and you can see how 9/11 ushered in the military style police techniques
Cassie Cordon,30:45,that's why its so important to vote in local elections and vote in general. so we can have laws implemented to put more pressure on cops to behave properly.
Ameerah Muhammad,30:47,@nodhill we had a Black President for 8 years. Nothing changed. Because the issue goes deeper than who is in the Oval Office
Jessica Barone,30:48,Rising Out of Hatred was life changing
Sussex Sandra,30:50,The live chat is not showing on my screen so I don’t know what everyone is saying.
Monz,30:55,AVERIA GASKIN I agree! So tired of colourpop - I need luxury! Haha
Michell,30:55,Chicago cops were literally turning off their bodycams and removing their badges so people can't hold them accountable. imagine all the things we haven't been seeing in social media.
sandy5791,30:56,Are there good children's books to help explain things to kids?
Makeup Junky,30:59,MAKEUP!!! I’m here to get away!!! Thanks Jen! ❤️

Marvalous,31:43,I’m sad today - praying for peace
Angeline,31:44,sandy what do you mean this? riots
Miranda Stephens,31:45,yes @makeup junky! I think it would be good for everyone to have an hr to get away
Jessica Barone,31:46,"sandy, go follow the conscious kid on Instagram for children's books"
Erica W,31:46,"They can’t charge murder 1 or 2 given what the statute says. They need to prove premeditation in order to charge higher and sadly although I wish he was charged with murder 1, they won’t argue it."
Isabel,31:50,Have you or does your family play video games.
Katie Stevens,31:51,Do not talk about makeup. It's not appropriate.
manderjack,31:51,apparently the officer had had dozens of previous police conduct complaints. There needs to be a very in depth investigation into those in charge for allowing that man to remain in law enforcement.
Heather Rubino,31:52,I believe that we as white women possess the authority to influence in our communities to effect change
Scottilicious McFabulous,31:58,Yeah live chat is being buggy
Ameerah Muhammad,31:59,Also please stop asking black people to do the work for you and explain things. There are TONS of resources easily available through Google.
Talestra,32:00,"I hope its alright to say, to my melanin enhanced sisters and brothers; you don't know me, and I am of limited privilege, but I will always stand for you, and not stand by while you are wronged."
Jessica Schnupp,32:00,"There are videos of police joining the march in Flint, conversations between the police and protestors in Phoenix and the peaceful protests in Grand Rapids. But the media focus stays on the violence."
Mary Dixon,32:03,@Maria vassallo depends on what you like but to start with I would go with Naked 1!
Patrícia Carreira,32:04,Please Jen speak on what we as white people need to do so we can help! is important to share that. Being quite is supporting those with privilege
Samantha Darbonne,32:04,I dont understand how the deadly virus we are dealing with has just been forgotten for these protests. So many people so close together.
sandy5791,32:04,No...racial issues/concerns.
Sarah's Nail Secrets,32:07,Same I just click Jen again and chat pops back up almost like refresh
Tiffany PK,32:07,"Let’s also remember that without dissension and riots, we wouldn’t have the country we live in now."
Heidi Foley,32:13,It’s happening to me too
Shanti Mattie,32:16,Change the setting at the top of the screen on the right. It was only showing top chat instead of all live chat for me.
Jennifer Ruiz,32:16,theres a few @sandy5791 race should be spoken to children as early as a year and a half bc of developmental milestones and processing.. but definitely what youre comfortable with as a parent.
T Wrendy,32:19,Clicking out and clicking back in will help. Chat stopped for me too

Marisa Irven,32:30,"I wish people could react to this whole situation as if George Floyd was their father, their brother , or their husband. Maybe then this will be as outrageous to people who are “unaffected”"

Tiffany PK,34:42,Hey @AmeerahMuhammad
Karen Smith,34:47,"@manderjack deflects from the message. We had centuries of knowing white lives matter. Doesn't need to be said. You apparently have to yell, scream, punch 4 some to recognize that black lives matter."
Heather Rubino,34:47,I believe that we as white women possess the authority to influence in our communities to effect change

Gen Giovannone,35:57,Collective Brain Elite에 오신 것을 환영합니다
Jen Fangirl,36:02,"I think the book ""So you wanna talk about race"" should be required reading as well. It was uncomfortable and so eye opening."

Maricela Sanchez,36:21,Every time I see the violence it makes me cry. Why can’t we show kindness to one another.
Betty Wilder,36:24,When one side breaks the social contract we all agree to live by then chaos ensues. There is a peaceful protest in my town today at the police station.
MillieMoo CKCMILLIEMOO,36:24,Thank you for the live chats!!
Luanne Santos,36:25,New Jersey police are walking with protesters. They’re bringing water and food for everyone too
Marisa Irven,36:27,If white people were afraid of the police who are supposed to help and not take their lives things would be so different. As a Latina after the border problem I’m afraid to be in public or near a cop
Kat Sm-Wo,36:28,What do the Green member things at the top of the screen mean
Renee Revolinski,36:29,@JayJay - so true
Scottilicious McFabulous,36:32,How do you feel about big Youtubers going out to malls and looting?
AngelSKitCat,36:40,Will you be getting the CREMATED PALETTE???
Jennifer Ruiz,36:40,100% @Betty Wilder
Sussex Sandra,36:40,I think what also needs to be looked at is White Priviedge and Police relations. Think about Amy Cooper this week. That totally gives context to White Priviledge.
Paula Blue,36:50,who was doing that? scott
Ameerah Muhammad,36:52,@Jessica Barone exactly. Thank you. We are TIRED.
Nikki Crayons,36:59,we are too used to being COMFORTABLE to have the hard discussions with open ears

MARKY MARK,37:06,Omg 😂😂😂❤️❤️
DQ4eva363,37:09,thoughts on jaclyn's latest videos?
Machteld Sofia,37:09,We all know that not all cops are bad ones. The problem is that the bad ones are louder and it has to stop.
Mayra L,37:10,💯 Sandra.
Phyrra Nyx,37:10,"There are so many great books and tv shows to help educate you. Google 'children's books on racism' Watch shows like Dear White People, Blackish, Mixedish, you can definitely find great resources"
Luanne Santos,37:19,She said she wasn’t going to get the Cremated palette
Monz,37:20,I recommend the Netflix documentary called “13th” about racial inequality in your country. Jen Luvs Reviews. A great place to start.
BRIT CLARKE,37:22,There’s a protest in my small city today and it’s terrifying. I’m praying it remains civil

Shirley,37:31,Yup that would be me lol 😂 I joined
Laura Mac,37:31,@bardlover6 I agree
Jessica Barone,37:42,"yes Paula, I didn't know what it meant and got called out by a black influence for going about it that way. I chose then to unpack my privilege and do the work. I needed to face my fragility."
Makeup with Michelle,37:43,@monz that's a very eye opening documentary
maricella888,37:45,@Marisa Irven Me too
Fearless Beauty Queen,37:48,I don’t trust a lot of officers. I will never forget the day they surrounded pulled out guns on my husband. Because “he matched the description of a black male” It was the scariest day of my life.
Lycia Tomlinson,37:49,"@Heather Rubino Covid twice since Jan., no friends since this dministration, and living in an extremely racist area of NC makes it impossiblee for me at the moment, but I agree."
Erin McManaway,37:52,Keep giving recommendations for extra reading and research on these issues! Education is the best tool to fight ignorance
Monika luvs beauty420,37:56,"so when school goes back, theyll most likely be wearing masks..."
Tracie 3,38:00,I feel violence causes more fear by all though..
Angi English,38:01,Collective Brain Elite에 오신 것을 환영합니다
Nikki Crayons,38:05,im scared to join the protests but i believe in what black people are doing!
Justine Couture,38:05,i feel really helpless right now with the situation. it is infuriating - i woke up this morning with a message from lady gaga that pretty much summed up why i feel
Nat GL,38:07,can't believe I finally caught a stream! hi from spain! :)
Monika luvs beauty420,38:08,because of the viruae

MzzVixen,38:14,"Hi Jen, I'm 60 yrs old and remember hearing Dr King talking on the TV , I wasn't old enough to completely understand what he was talking about, but his words and passion touched me,"
ana puentes,38:15,"Hi Jen, I suggest everybody reads “Me and white supremacy”, written by a black woman, and focused on bringing awareness especially to white or visually white people"
Mandy S.,38:16,I think there are ways to support rn that can tie in to your content. You could do a vid on black owned makeup companies? Ora specific stream guesting black creators & donate superchat proceeds.
Julie,38:17,It was an awesome video
Tiffany PK,38:18,"@AmeerahMuhammad I’ll be honest, I’m emotionally exhausted and consistently disappointed. I have a 20 year old son for whom I’m terrified. How are you doing?"
PhoenixBella,38:20,i cried a lot last night thinking Floyd's last words. i live in Finland and wonder where is US going? i'm afraid for you guys. we need peace. this racism has to stop

Ursula TheAwesome,38:27,that curve is gonna be really curvy after all these riots. poor nurses and doctors
Aisha Khalil,38:29,Oh trevor noah is the best. His book is so good.
Gen Giovannone,38:29,exactly
Katie Stevens,38:30,The people attempting to change the subject are the epitome of privilege.
Paula Blue,38:32,well said.
Jen Fangirl,38:40,"Try the books titled ""A kids book about..."" They address Race, Feminism, LBGTQ+ and other hot button issues."
Jennifer Ruiz,38:46,@Sussex Sandra absolutely... just like books like white fragility and stamped from the beginning both are amazing
Mary Dixon,38:46,Hei Suomi
Monika luvs beauty420,38:49,that is very true jen
Sarojin Abhi,38:49,"This all started in my home neighborhood, where I used to play as a kid. My brothers are participating in peaceful protests and exposing outside instigators. I'm so proud"
Erin McManaway,38:51,Look at articles like unpacking the invisible knapsack
Tracie 3,38:51,That’s a good way of wording it unfortunately
Chris Leeds,38:51,I am white privileged... I am a white passing POC... the confusion and despair is difficult and soul crushing
Graciela,38:52,@katestevens yes haha
Valerie Stewart,38:55,@Katie Stevens agree.
MzzVixen,38:57,"I have tried to live to help get his dream to become real, and when President Obama was elected twice I had hope too that we were closer to Dr King's dream"
Shirley,39:11,Love ya my friend I have to get back to the heating pad. Have a good day 🌞
maricella888,39:13,@Katie Stevens Exactly!
Katie Burns,39:17,White privilege has nothing to do with economics
MARKY MARK,39:25,Yes I think a lot of people misunderstand what white privilege is
Becky Miller,39:32,The website Here Wee Read has a list of books on diversity.
Ameerah Muhammad,39:33,@Tiffany Ponds-Kembro angry sad and scared for my brother. I live with him and his godson.
Life Of Jenn,39:38,hey Jenn
lilbitspunky,39:39,Another problem is the lower standards for new officers that have been integrated throughout the past few years... fewer background checks and counciling
Monz,39:39,George Floyd “I can’t breathe”
Julie,39:40,"i’m a middle-aged white woman, I have a privilege. I struggle, but I acknowledge that my struggle is not the same."
Mayra L,39:40,Oh Katie....that is far from the truth.
PenniePlatinum,39:41,I didn't understand white privilege until I attended a multiculturalism series. It was a real eye opener.
MzzVixen,39:41,"but we have gone backwards so much, I'm again afraid. we never will"
Caitlyn Kirby,39:43,"That’s exactly it about white privilege. In my college class of human service majors, we took a poll and many of the people in class don’t believe it😐"
LV Linda6,39:46,And in Rhodesia it is the opposite. It is the white people are getting slaughtered.
Melinda Clark,39:47,I suggest read the book Born a Crime by Trevor Noah. He grew up in South Africa during apartheid
cheerynesstv,39:48,hi everyone...late to this conversation
Katie Stevens,39:53,@katie burns can you elaborate? I don't understand your viewpoint.
Jennifer Ruiz,39:57,white privilege makes white people uncomfortable.. bc it is the assumption of it being personalized .. many dont understand that term...
Hapa Rat,39:58,I'm in the Seattle area and one officer maced a 9 year old girl in the face yesterday - and the officers had their badge numbers taped so people can't see it. This is all so beyond my comprehension!
Nikki Crayons,39:59,white privilege = getting a head start in the race of live
Justine Couture,39:59,white privilege is real. and people have to stop thinking that by saying we are privileged it is taking something away from us
Jo Va,40:00,"it makes me so happy to see white ppl like you talk about this. we need you. it takes a lot of self control to see the deniers and not @ them , but i’m growing lol"
Sharron G,40:03,Beauty influencer Amanda Ensing has a beautiful tribute on instagram stories to #blacklivesmatter and what she can do to help acknowledging her light skin privilege even tho she's half Puerto Rico.
Graciela,40:06,Another great first step is to follow Alicia Garza on Instagram. She is the founder of black lives matter.
Nat GL,40:08,"I think a lot of white people are too busy saying ""but I'm not racist"" instead of educating themselves"
Angie B,40:10,Thank you for talking about this Jen! It's difficult to focus on makeup with everything going on in the world
Angeline,40:12,yes Mark!! exactly. they don't even know that they scream white privilege
Tonya Hall,40:13,Protests scheduled here in Jacksonville Fl today. It will get violent. Police here are very power hungry. Not all but....I’m scared for my grown son to even go in public.
dioneculbert,40:16,"omg...u have have to search ""how to be anti racist "" to explain to ur children...i. just cant..."
Trashley Fellers,40:17,"if you feel defensive at the term ""white privilege"" take a step back & examine why that is."
Unapologetically Mocha,40:18,White privilege =/= economic status.
Paula Kauffman,40:22,"Yes, it does!"
Jenn J,40:23,"I feel like while the protests are warranted, it feels like a bunch of quarentine energy. It wasn’t the BLM protesters that turned a car over and pooped on it in SLC UT. It was a bunch of brats"
Chris Leeds,40:24,Privilege has so much do with this and definitely with economics
Cosmic Slice,40:28,"some people think that ""white privilege' minimizes another person's struggle and it doesn't. But there are those who use the term to try and silence people."
A.K. C.,40:31,It ABSOLUTELY does
Deanna W,40:35,I think there’s a misunderstanding on white privilege because different people accuse others of it for a small thing. People on both sides misuse it hence the misunderstanding across the board
Ameerah Muhammad,40:48,It’s not enough to be “not racist” you have to be anti-racist.
Vishal Sharma haldiniya,40:49,hello
Angie B,40:51,There have been protests in Denver every day.
Mayra L,40:57,It absolutely does. It’s called systemic racism.
Jessica Barone,40:57,"When white people are confronted with their bigotry and privilege, it feels like oppression."
maricella888,40:58,Read Ta-Nehisi Coates books.
Katherine Kempton,41:02,"I feel like privilege isn't (pardon the turn of phrase), black and white. You can be privileged in one way (white), but not in others (female, gay, etc.). We have to use our privilege to help others."
Home Team,41:03,of course white priv plays into economics
Paula Kauffman,41:04,There are plenty of maps that show how race and economics are heavily correlated.
Sussex Sandra,41:06,White Privilege has EVERYTHING to do with White Privilege.
Nikki Crayons,41:07,"if white privilege had nothing to do with economics, target wouldn't have been burnt to the ground"
Kimberly Stewart,41:07,I’m glad you are talking about this.
Unapologetically Mocha,41:11,Privilege is being able to move through society without flaring questioned about your actions.
Emmy G,41:13,"white people on average make more, so yes white privilege does affect economics"
Elizabethann Ferrario,41:13,Forgive me but I can longer watch as yes distressing!
nodhill,41:20,white privilege unltimately has everything to with economics. Red Lining is something as a white person you dont deal with...
Tracie 3,41:21,How would you handle explaining this to your class if you were teaching?
IndigobluBeauty,41:21,"The criminal justice system is built on racism. Definitely watch the 13th on Netflix, ie “the criminalization of blackness”"
Jennifer Ruiz,41:25,very valid point.. @Deanna W
LucaXtagVtag,41:27,I'm working hard!
Amy,41:29,Wow. I'm glad I dropped in for this live chat. It's great that we're having this hard conversation and not just talking about makeup. THANK YOU.
MARKY MARK,41:29,1 of the issues is he wasn’t taken into custody the minute he was fired. Firing him was acknowledgment that he crossed the line & went against his duties. They acknowledged the murder but no arrest
Trish Brennan,41:30,"White people need tostop lecturing at black folks when and what to be upset about, how to ""peacefully"" protest. Stop asking them to be endlessly patient, forgiving, and sensitive to white feelings."
Kaila Deiman,41:37,"But, being white means you have more opportunities to overcome your struggles and poverty."
Kristin F,41:41,"I can fully understand why people are going to violence rn. When the very ppl who are supposed to keep us is safe result to violence and kill people, how are other ppl suppose to react??"
Gabriela Rovi,41:46,I think it’s also really hard for people to understand that minorities have to fight over the scraps on humanity given out by white people. So we are pitted against each other and are used as fuel
Angie Rice,41:47,"unfortunately a lot of white people don't understand that white privilege isn't something YOU do, it's something that's done TO you, without your knowing"
Jessica Barone,41:47,"katherine if you can leave your house without being afraid of the police because of the color of your skin, that is white privilege"
Unapologetically Mocha,41:50,Without being questioned about your actions.
Jayne Lim,41:50,sometimes the most basic of things are the hardest to explain
Katherine Kempton,41:51,"Also, white privilege has EVERYTHING to do with economics, from redlining in housing to generational wealth."
Graciela,41:52,Dionculbert- yes it is frustrating when you have to explain something so simple as “search how to be anti racist”...I am just trying to help educate so black people don’t have to wast their energy
Angi English,41:56,I live here in MN and I have hardly slept at all since this all started. I am scared and heartbroken. Especially for my granddaughter who is part African-American. She's 7 and can't understand....
Jo Va,41:57,"white privilege STARTS with economics. what did slavery sustain? the economy. who does the economy benefit , white ppl. who will most likely get the job? who will be asked to leave the store?"
Talestra,42:00,"the moment people hear ""privilege "" they feel attacked. Instead of owning it and using it for the benefit of the human race."
Trashley Fellers,42:01,"it's not enough to simply be ""not racist"" you must be Anti-racist"
Mandy S.,42:02,"Yeah. You can't just explain to your children not to be racist, you have to explain to them the ways other people are racist and to recognize micro-aggressions and systemic issues."
nodhill,42:03,white privilege unltimately has everything to with economics. Red Lining is something as a white person you dont deal with...
Angie B,42:07,There's nothing wrong with doing research to aid with explaining white privilege
Ursula TheAwesome,42:08,What is happening now is called Divide and Conquer. It is easy to manipulate
Jennifer Ruiz,42:09,explaining white privilege to a child goes back to the language you speak because child process things differently based on the developmental stage they are at.
ChloeTKMakeup,42:11,When you have people like Jake Paul our looting you realise that a lot of the violence and looting is not coming from black protesters
Gina V,42:12,I just wish people would start looking at each other as fellow human beings instead of the color of their skin or their sex etc.
Tiffany PK,42:17,@CaitlynKirby and that is part of the larger problem. If you don’t think you’re a part of the problem you don’t even care about a solution.
Betty Wilder,42:18,@Maria vassallo I'm 50 too and my best suggestion is a self-curated palette from Makeup Geek.
dioneculbert,42:26,I'm a 42 yr old black woman BTW
Jessica Barone,42:27,"unpack your fragility, white folx, please."
Marisa Irven,42:31,@jessica barone yesssssss!
Maricela Sanchez,42:38,"I’m an educator, my students have so many questions. I don’t know where to start. They ask me questions, I’m their teacher and they want answers from me. How do I help them understand?"
Machteld Sofia,42:46,It's sad that a country such as the US has so much issues like that. With the amount of diversity it has it could be such a great country. It's really sad.
Potat Z,42:47,i still cannot understand how the us preaches to be the beacon of freedom and democracy while theres so much discrimination in the country itself
Karen Smith,42:48,The fact that white people are tuning out because they find the topic distressing is the epitome of white privilege. People of color never get to tune out of their skin color.
Jaime K.,42:49,I saw a post saying a white woman understood her privilege while at a protest. White people formed a line between police and the black/brown protestors. The police backed off immediately. Privilege.
jg heart,42:52,there is even racism in the black culture based on just how dark or light their skin tone is.
manderjack,42:54,we should also acknowledge the good things happening too like those who have come together to help clean up the destruction as a result of the riots. that's what helps me right now
Monz,42:55,Indigoblubeauty i just watched 13th. My friend recommended it to me and I’m so happy I watched it.
Jennifer Ruiz,42:56,white privilege affects every system in place that america was founded on...
Emme Juliana,42:57,It is indeed systemic racism. Apathy and ignorance about racism in a systemically racist culture IS somewhat racist. So is not acknowledging your access and privilege as a non-POC.
Kimberly Stewart,43:00,The systemic nature of it
Claudine Hardy,43:01,I read an article this morning explaining that the guy with his knee on George's neck has been charges with manslaughter and third degree murder. lastly love everyone like they deserve
Mary Dixon,43:07,Very fortunate to live in a diverse city (Ann Arbor MI)
Angi English,43:12,"""why that happened to the man who looks like her""....😢"
Katie Burns,43:15,"I should edit, I meant it doesn’t not matter how you grew up...poor or wealthy, white people are privileged no matter their economic standing"
Amy P and Dirty too,43:15,"children understand things differently than adults, so yeah, searching a way to explain racism to them isnt ridiculous at all.🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️"
Jennifer Giaramita,43:26,"I shouldnt have to say im not a racist. My actions and treatment of people prove Im not. Its not a ""badge of honor"" or something to be proud of. It should just be how people are."
Sarojin Abhi,43:27,I moved to North Georgia 18 years ago and I've never wanted to move back to MN more. So much ignorance around here.
MzzVixen,43:27,"I lived with racemized everyday, both my parents were very raciest, and tried to get me to be like them, they tried to scare me with people of color and what they would do to me,"
Maggie Sugar,43:29,well said Jen!
Chris Leeds,43:30,Privilege really is a thing. coming from a person that is passing... when people find out I'm not white... I do get treated differently
Sandy P,43:30,I respect you Jen. We all know it’s hard to have these difficult conversations. We have to start somewhere and just do our best.
Lark E.,43:31,"Hi, Jen❣️"
IndigobluBeauty,43:34,@monz very eye opening! Watched it with my son
cheerynesstv,43:35,yes @Katie Burns
Ti Galloway,43:35,"Heavy chat, but I think this topic does need to permeate every topic just to help get the message out. The more voices you hear hopefully the sooner change will happen"
Jennifer Ruiz,43:39,100% @manderjack
Eliza Moeller,43:40,"The term ""white privilege"" helps us isolate race in conversations about oppression. Isolating race - as a related but distinct force from economics - is really important to do in anti-racist work."
Kristin F,43:41,2 weeks ago my dad got arrested for a failure to appear and he was on his knees with his hands behind his back and they still beat him up and stomped his head very bad& gave him a broken nose. 🤬
Marwa Ramsis Farag,43:51,"yes, black people have to work twice as hard..."
Teresa Maldonado,43:52,Wow
Casey KC,43:53,"we need a society that makes success accessable!! that is a huge problem we all live in poverty and are angry, the people up top don't care"
Anna Putnam,43:58,I have bipolar disorder and have been physically tortured for absolutely no reason other than the officers pleasure MANY times during my manias. I am white... the way some police officers are sadistic
Mr Pac-Man,43:59,I think there are a lot of peaceful protests
MelliLynn nnn,44:03,I am from the twin cities... our city is so broken. The Tea pot has boiled over while it had whistled for WAY TOO LONG!
Banshee Muse,44:06,"if you treat someone bad for the color of their skin, you are a piece of crap."
Nikki Crayons,44:09,stop making excuses
Ameerah Muhammad,44:09,You can be a successful rich black man and STILL be pulled over by police in your own neighborhood. THATS the difference
maricella888,44:10,The original stain in the US is slavery which we still haven't dealt with.
Monika luvs beauty420,44:15,"I'm so scared to put on the news today, it's sad, horrible, scary..."
Amanda Harp,44:17,I MADE IT!!!
Jennifer Ruiz,44:27,@Chris Leeds exactly.. i see it all the time. people dont know what i am.. assume white and then when they realize im not.. its a huge problem.. i understand that sentiment and your reality.
nodhill,44:32,white privilege unltimately has everything to with economics. Red Lining is something as a white person you dont deal with...
A.K. C.,44:42,Their skin color isn’t a barrier
Mary Dixon,44:47,police are being trained in a much more violent way since 9/11
Unapologetically Mocha,44:55,"White privilege: If a white person pulls out a credit card for a purchase, no one questions it. If a POC does it, an ID is required."
ChloeTKMakeup,45:02,"Jake Paul and plenty of other white, privileged people were involved in looting but black protesters will be blamed"
MzzVixen,45:15,"at an early age I fought against their belief's and butted heads with them on it and to so extent still do, and raised me kids to look past a persons skin and look at the person, themselves"
EnchantedWings,45:19,I have attended a unconscious bias training last year. It's eye opening to see how unconscious biases affect all of us in different ways.
Mayra L,45:20,"Red lining, loan approvals, etc"
cheerynesstv,45:20,"it's difficult to say things in the right way, in this moment, because it can be taken so many different ways by so many people"
Jennifer Ruiz,45:22,absolutely.. @Unapologetically Mocha or shopping in a higher boutique and instantly security is stalking you
Jacqui Dias,45:27,As a POC I watched the struggle first hand. I don’t condone looting and all that but dayum HEAR US !!!!
Trashley Fellers,45:31,there are certain challenges they will never have have to face simply due to the color of their skin
IndigobluBeauty,45:31,@mellilynn nnn from the twin cities here too! The officer lives in my neighborhood. Originally from Northside
Chris Leeds,45:33,@Jennifer Ruiz It is heart braking. Do you also get dismissed by other people from your POC background? I do. I'm not PR enough
Graciela,45:34,White privelege=you have benefits just by by white. I am a light skinned Mexican woman. I benefit from white privelege bc I often pass for white.
Melissa Fallenstein,45:34,putting your knee on someone's neck is not something Police Officers are trained to do
Julie,45:37,hate is taught
nerdlingful,45:40,Think of the cops in a Utah who were caught on video pushing N elderly white man with a cane to the ground for no apparent reason. The man was crawling away in fear and the same cops picked him up.
cc84ist,45:42,don't be so hard on yourself with words. I understand being mindful but it is just as important to speak truth.
True Baronesse,45:44,You said white privilege doesn't mean you don't struggle - but skin color isn't one of those struggles.
Jessica Barone,45:46,"Mary dixon, look up warrior training. Our municipality in NEPA denounced it years ago and has publicly came out against violent tactics like this."
Claudine Hardy,45:46,the man has been charged with manslaughter and third degree murder
Mandy S.,45:53,Everyone saying they would respect peaceful protests need to remember how white people in the country reacted so pitifully to football players taking a knee. The goalpost is always moving.
Talestra,45:56,"We all have a part to play, we are all responsible. I was sent the link to that video, watched it with my husband. I was in tears and I looked at him, he's not a cryer, but his eyes were wet and he"

Katie Stevens,46:20,"I love your son, oh my God"
Nicole Banker,46:25,"my 4yo daughter doesn't know racism. i pray she will understand that sadly, it does exist, but we love all people."
Katrina Wilson,46:27,Bless his heart!
Jennifer Ruiz,46:27,@Chris Leeds absolutely.. im afro cuban puerto rican with pale and dark complexions and im also sicilian and have some family from naples.. i dont identify with being white.. its a huge issue..
GingerJeanie,46:33,It is so frustrating as a white person who is trying to not be racist to deal with the denial of other white people when it comes to white privilege and racism. Even one’s own family can be guilty.
dioneculbert,46:34,The reason I said that is because I am a 42 year old black woman and thats the fundamental problem with this world: hate and racism start at HOME...and what u teach them from birth...
Teri Birrell,46:34,So innocent
Marisa Irven,46:36,Awe your sons adorable!
Unapologetically Mocha,46:43,White privilege: a white person in a Range Rover is no big deal. A POC in a Range Rover will get pulled over.
Sussex Sandra,46:45,Everybody has an opportunity to be economically successful. The ride upwards has less obstacles the lighter your skin colour. It depends on how many unexplained knock backs a person can take.
Banshee Muse,46:47,"Peaceful Protesting is a right, but looting, burning, and assaulting police officers is wrong."
ALXSSA,46:48,"@chloe kemmer Yes! This is why i disagree with looting. Many people aren't for the cause and are coming just to steal, and then it will be blamed on BLM."
Tracie 3,46:53,Exactly.. Children aren’t born racist..
sandy5791,47:02,Just bought three books from a kids book about... thank you to whomever recommended them.
Isabel,47:02,Children do see the world in interesting ways.
Tiphani Hills,47:04,it's sad how my skin color is seen as threatening. It makes me feel out of place sometimes to be honest.
Heather Rubino,47:04,I believe that we as white women possess the authority to influence in our communities to effect change
Jacqui Dias,47:05,My father was successful but he had to do 3 times the work of his white counterpart and get skipped over 9 times for a promotion to finally get it and nameless money than the white man under him
Jennifer Ruiz,47:08,@Chris Leeds but thats whole nothing issue with multi ethnic people and getting dismissed from both sides or all sides.. but i understand as much as i can black and brown sentiments on this.
Graciela,47:15,More POC are dying bc of the systemic issues that block them from receiving adequate preventative medical care. Along with many other things
Tracey's Fashion Outlook,47:17,@nerdlingful I saw that video and couldn't believe what I was seeing
Angel Griffin,47:22,White fragility is an amazing book on racism from a socialist standpoint Robin DiAngelo
Mayra L,47:25,Yes Gracie.
MzzVixen,47:30,"I disagree Jen, as I said I fought against my parents belief's since I was young"
Vivi Crespo,47:31,That’s true dioneculbert.
Erin McManaway,47:31,Policing has been continually made more militaristic for years. The system we have in this country has been built on racism and is working exactly how it was designed to.
Victoria Thompson,47:35,"at least most protestors I have seen are wearing masks. meanwhile when I have to tell a customer they have to wear a mask to enter my store they throw a fit. We have bigger problems, Karen."
Julie,47:35,"this is our world right now, talking about it helps,  at least it helps me"
Elizabeth Guillot,47:54,"I think with kids it's an ongoing discussion, not one and done. My kid is 14 and the conversation has evolved every time we have it."
ALXSSA,47:55,What Amy Cooper did was white privilege. It exist don't act like it doesn't.
Sarojin Abhi,47:57,"I have an insanely hard time getting interviews when I'm looking for a job, I often wonder if it's my name holding me back"
Jenny K,47:57,And don't forget that it's uncomfortable as a white person to admit to that privilege. It's easier to turn the other cheek and pretend that it's not real.
LaShawn W,48:02,I'm bi racial black and even I experience privilege due to my lighter skin. It's a real thing.
Paula Kauffman,48:06,It was in NYC.
dioneculbert,48:08,Thank you so much Vivi!!
PeachyKyna,48:12,I saw police shove an old man to the ground.
ChloeTKMakeup,48:16,An eight year old black girl got maced in the face walking home - she wasn’t even at the protests just walking home
Jennifer Ruiz,48:18,@Chris Leeds i agree. its insane.. so i understand your sentiments.. but luckily all of my black and brown brothers and sisters accept me bc they know who i am.
Nancy Howell,48:25,I’m 73 and grew up in Baltimore. I was teaching in 1968 when Dr King was assassinated. The riots are still very fresh in my memory. This year reminds me so much of ‘68. So upsetting.
MelliLynn nnn,48:26,"people need to begin to use their white privilege to speak up for those who are silenced! if one more person says ""all lives matter"" I am going to LOSE IT!!"
Ameerah Muhammad,48:31,@LaShawn I am light-skinned black woman and I have light skin privilege.
CarmiMl0v3,48:33,the cop that did that was identified. unfortunately the girl who was pushed suffered a seizure.
MzzVixen,48:38,and that tiny young girl to the ground and his supervisor was next to him and didnt do anything
Makeup with Mia,48:38,"yeah, I was thinking of the little girl in Seattle"
Mandy S.,48:39,Cops instigate violence because they know that peaceful protests make them look bad. When protesters are incited to violence police get their excuse to pull out batons and pepper spray.
Mayra L,48:40,Yes @nodhill
cheerynesstv,48:41,i think these police are not trained properly in conflict de-escalation and resort to aggressive tactics..which get more brutal the darker the color of your skin
Happy Alyssa29,48:41,"so a great big heavy girl would have been less of a victim than the ""tiny girl""?"
Chris Leeds,48:43,@Jennifer Ruiz I also understand... being in the middle is hard because nobody understands why I'm so horribly upset and agree with the outrage...
Gin R,48:50,Riots are the voice of the unheard. We haven't heard them. This is our failing as a country to not addressing the issue.
Julie,48:59,cell phone cameras have change the way that this kind of thing is perceived. Always before the protesters and the rioters were 100% in the wrong
Emme Juliana,49:01,I was so upset by the photojournalist who lost her eye
S E,49:01,"It's also scary how the police is shooting rubber bullets and gasing the media, a swedish reporter was shot and it just shows how scary they are and out of control"
Tiffany PK,49:03,"@Julie we have to be made aware, living in a bubble is not good for any of us. Me too, I also need to be more conscious."
Jennifer Ruiz,49:04,@Unapologetically Mocha amongst many other situations just purely based on skin tone. and thats the problem with cops if you need to hide your badge youre doing something you know is wrong
Sarojin Abhi,49:09,Amy Cooper is the perfect example of someone knowing their privilege and using it as a weapon
Graciela,49:11,Mandy- yes!
Averia Gaskin,49:13,Raw beauty kristi showed an old white man with a cane being thrown to the ground in Utah
Jessica Barone,49:15,Gin R. soooo so true
Banshee Muse,49:20,Most of you don't understand is this is going to get more deadly and violent. I cannot stress that police and business owners have the right to use dealy force.
ChloeTKMakeup,49:21,Police have also been specifically targeting journalists who are recording
maricella888,49:23,"Jen speak to the Amy Cooper situation and all the other ""Karens"" out there."
cheerynesstv,49:27,yes @Sarojin Abhi
LaShawn W,49:27,@Ameerah yes!
Phyrra Nyx,49:28,"I mentioned this before, without the Stonewall Riots (led by POC), we would have no LGBTQIA rights. People riot when they're left with no other option"
Gin R,49:35,Every white person should listen to the Seeing White podcast by Duke Univeraity. So eyeopening.
JennEwithNoY,49:38,@jenny k I don't feel uncomfortable. I was born this way. I am what I am
Courtacular,49:43,I thought we weren't supposed to be political in the comments
Trish Brennan,49:44,"I am white,. To me, my white privilege means I will be more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt that I am a decent, trustworthy person by society by default. That has meaningful advantages."
manderjack,49:51,I'd like to applaud the guy who was conceal carrying for getting the AR 15 away from that kid too. that could have ended so much worse than it did
Gabriela Rovi,49:53,"I live by a police station and a large public hospital and all I hear now are sirens 24 hrs a day. its scary and the government does nothing to fix it, any of it"
xCaykex,50:03,the problem I'm having with the protests that in Lansing Michigan people were there with guns and they could keep themselves from reacting to them. but yet if they were black... it'd be different
Vivi Crespo,50:04,Who is Amy Cooper? Thanks
Jennifer Ruiz,50:10,@Chris Leeds absolutey.. like we have to prove our blackness or whiteness..its unnecessary... but most of the world is hurting.. so my struggles i deal with.. i invest my energy into advocacy.
Angie B,50:12,@Trish Brennan what an excellent way to put it.
Aisha Khalil,50:14,They are brutal when they use excessive force. And I feel like some officers become jaded over time
Betty Wilder,50:14,"These police issues have always been happening it's just that they're all on film now, thank God"
Julie,50:17,Any Cooper is a perfect example of someone using white
MzzVixen,50:19,"no, I fought against my parents on a lot of things, race, drinking, and many of their other belief's at a young age so I think for me it was easier to have the ability to fight them"
Averia Gaskin,50:21,Banshee cops have the right to mace little white children? That is what my black eyes saw
cheerynesstv,50:25,exactly @xCaykex
Mandy S.,50:28,"Banshee, this is already deadly and violent for black people. That's why people are protesting."
cc84ist,50:31,we do not want Marshall Law
lesley henry,50:32,@Gin R Where can you find that podcast?
Katrina Wilson,50:52,The chat disappeared.
Jennifer Ruiz,50:53,the educational system is a system that is meant to create the cradle to prison pipeline.. its made to institutionalize black and brown youth
Jessica Barone,50:56,"cops are often trained with a system called Warrior Style. look it up guys, it's scary, being trained to believe every citizen that is non the eurocentric norm is so awful"
Bri Steinke,51:02,This has always been an issue between minorities and law enforcement. Social media is making it more visible. We have to stand with the black communities against these injustices.
Joviesmom *,51:03,I joined late. I know this is a heavy topic and I don’t want to take away from it. Have you discussed the Stauffer family adoption situation that has surfaced?
DMG,51:04,if this happened in the uk I might have jumped in to try and push the cop off but I dont think I would have been brave enough to do the same if I was in the US. Btw I am a criminal defence lawyer.
Nikki Crayons,51:04,martial
Julie,51:06,People did throw a fit about seatbelts. I remember that
Robyn Fairchild,51:11,thanks Jen ... This is an important message
sandy5791,51:12,I'm in healthcare...please wear masks. I was the only person wearing one when I went out this weekend.
Erin McManaway,51:17,John Oliver has done a great piece on police militarization and Hasan Minhaj did a piece on the policing system. These guys also cite sources for people do to their own research
Feelin’Froggy,51:19,"I love what you do,; and stand for! Thank you for using your platform to offer a peaceful place to TALK!"
Gin R,51:20,"@Betty Wilder - Exactly. If there was no video, those officers would still be employed. Just shows what actually happens when cameras are not rolling!"
Misha Marx,51:21,I was falsely arrested once and thrown to the ground as a 96lb white female by a huge cop. And I’m white! I can only imagine what they would’ve done to me if I was black. Police brutality abounds.
Banshee Muse,51:27,"@Mandy S, but what if it is your house that gets burned and your job?"
Karina Nielsen,51:40,"We have racism in Denmark, but no where near the calliber in USA. That is SO scary."
Home Team,51:42,but there is no law yet you have to wear a mask it would need to be passed by legislation at this point
Aphreyst,51:44,Vivi Amy cooper is a white woman who was told by a black man to leash her dog and got mad so she called the police and shrieked that she was bring attacked by him while choking her dog viciously
Heather Rubino,51:44,I believe that we as white women possess the authority to influence in our communities to effect change
Annabelle Ng,51:52,"I'm grow up with closed minded parents, I am glad that my mindset turned out different. I'm not from USA, but it is sad that the country is in such a state. it doesn't seem the leader is capable imo"
Sussex Sandra,51:53,@trish Brennan. That is exactly it. Thank you for understanding.
Nikki Crayons,51:57,omg heather
Sharon Pearson,52:01,yes!!! the seatbelt idea!! I hate that wearing a mask has become a partisan issue

Mandy S.,52:05,"Banshee, the lives and voices of people being killed matter more to me than material possessions."
Jennifer Ruiz,52:05,when i had to leave my house yesterday bc im an essential worker... i saw a group of white teens with a black teen. the black teen had a mask the white teens didnt.. i was like wow blatant privilege.
Angie B,52:05,"And honestly, not a lot of people want to deal with arguing with family."
Kelci Lewis,52:14,I don’t understand how stealing flat screen TVs and other things is protesting that Black Lives Matter? I can’t imagine living in a town that’s literally on fire right now and in pure chaos.
Laura Mac,52:14,What can't we all just live in peace with one another ...We are all the same inside 🖤💔
S E,52:15,"@GingerJeanie in Minneapolis, a photographer from Norway (where I'm from) was with her and they aimed a laser at him"

Jen Fangirl,52:22,"John Oliver did several good pieces, on Police Accountability and militarization ect... very informative"
Liz's Lushous Life,52:25,The young lady who was pushed to the ground ended up having seizures
cc84ist,52:25,most important is that the citizens rights are being infringed on so much more due to this covid situation.
Katie Stevens,52:33,only a fraction of police brutality is caught on film
cryceks,52:35,"I live in NY, but many people are still not wearing masks in stores. I had to go out to pick up a prescription a little while ago, now I'm home with bad symptoms and a pending covid test."
ChloeTKMakeup,52:36,People keep saying these things only happen in america but in it’s not the case. I’m from Scotland and black people are being murdered here too. This is a systemic problem and we have to speak up
Cosmic Slice,52:36,It's so weird that we had this horrible event happen the same day as the historic SpaceX launch
GingerJeanie,52:37,"Thank you, @Sir Eriksson."
Kirsten Arabie,52:38,I'm from South Africa & we've had several cases of Police and Army brutality during this lockdown..except its been Black Officers killing Black Civilians & it seems we only care when race is involved
Ameerah Muhammad,52:39,@Emma Julianna right?
Jessica Barone,52:43,"NatalaiaEnchantix, our country is built on eschewing respect for difference in fueling a need for a melting pot. what we know is safe, what is different is dangerous. puritanical belief systems."

cc84ist,53:19,laws and directives are 2 different things
Erin McManaway,53:21,Amy Cooper is the lady who hysterically called the cops claiming an African American man was attacking her when all he did was ask her to follow a rule in a park to have her dog on a leash
Jennifer Ruiz,53:24,@Aisha Khalil omg im so sorry for your loss
Chris Leeds,53:25,"@Jennifer Ruiz advocating is all I feel I can do. I""m not taken seriously in any other way"

Aphreyst,53:36,Vivi indeed!
Pelin Yildir,53:40,"I believe that most people don't think of themselves as racist. but you are right Jen, it goes so much deeper than that. it's institutionalised. Claudia Rankine writes about modern racism really well"
Nikki Crayons,53:43,she weaponized the police
Phyrra Nyx,53:45,"Amy Cooper pitched her voice to sound out of breath, like she was running for her life. she's a vile human"

Shelbylee,54:01,there are mask rules in some states
JenUnboxed,54:07,The heightened adrenaline that occurs during confrontations is part of the problem---I don't know what kind of de-escalation training officers go through but I wonder if more could help.
Jenn J,54:10,@nikki grace exactly @weaponizing police. Well said!
Paula Kauffman,54:15,That’s when White Privilege and position of power collaborate to silence the injustice that occurs towards POC- ex: Central Park 5.
Averia Gaskin,54:17,Aisha I am sorry for your loss
Talestra,54:19,"she was waving her junk around like she had a big one, I'm a non-violent person typically but if I'd have been there..."
Tiffany PK,54:23,"True, she knew. So it floors me when people do the same and act like they didn’t know. It’s 2020, you know."
Jennifer Ruiz,54:23,@Chris Leeds thats very unfortunate... im blessed to atleast have people who see through my work im not fake or false.. i just let my work do the talking.
Sharron G,54:32,Amy Cooper is white privilege.
Chris Leeds,54:32,"that amy coooper woman is freaking horrible. People are calling her ""karen"" like that is really the screwed up part"
Banshee Muse,54:41,"@Kristen Arabie, exactly because all lives should matter and I that so many people are shot in Chicago every weekend and nobody cares."
saucerjess,54:46,power corrupts
Nikki Crayons,54:47,"i was in a relationship with a black man for many years. we had problems. violence at times. i probably SHOULD have called the cops but no matter how rough shit got, i didnt want him to DIE so i never"
Mel,54:51,What did he do other than to ask her to leash her dog?? Her behavior disgusts me. I hope bringing this to light will make another white persona think again before doing this again!
Katherine Kempton,54:56,We need to use our privilege for good!
Pamela B99,55:02,I hate that we have racist acts but it does not give people free range in cites to burn and take what not what not there... two wrongs don’t make it right
Talestra,55:03,"Human? no ok, she cant sit with us"
Jennifer Ruiz,55:04,"@Chris Leeds ive done work with the naacp, working with nypd antibias training, ive worked with the cpe and immigration lawyers.. ive done antibias training in schools."
Julie,55:05,But she got a lot worse when she was on the phone with 911
Home Team,55:05,she deserves to get fired and suffer the back lash she is getting
Katie Stevens,55:06,@saucerjess there you go
Kathleen Sandoval,55:07,Actually for stores and businesses if they are inforcing the mask then its just like the no shirt no shoe no service plain and simple
Jacqui Dias,55:11,It’s just so hard you have to literally fear for your black child’s life everyday when they just go to school
IndigobluBeauty,55:22,I feel sad that as a black woman I feel like I need to have a gun myself for protection
Shelbylee,55:27,"That Amy Cooper situation was absolutely disgusting. She's watched the news, she knew what could happen by saying what she did in the voice she did."
Tiffany PK,55:33,"@saucerjess absolute power, corrupts absolutely, right?"
Chris Leeds,55:34,@Jennifer Ruiz I think it is partly because of my name. My last name is as white as it gets.
Nikki Crayons,55:36,all lives matter =all the houses are not on fire.
Mayra L,55:38,It minimizes the experience that’s why.
Ameerah Muhammad,55:48,@Chris Leeds being called Karen is NOT the worst of it. The worst of it is that she could have gotten him killed. Karen isn’t a slur and people need to stop painting it as such.
Talestra,55:50,"Every life matters, but our black and brown friends need the support. Who doesn't get that?"
Jenn J,55:52,He was smart to film it
Marisa Irven,55:57,@jacqui Dias yes! I one should fear their child’s life when they leave the house
Katherine Kempton,55:58,Yess^
Jessica Barone,56:01,Nikki Grace YES
Tracie 3,56:24,All lives do matter but black lives seem to be more disregarded then white..

Chris Leeds,56:43,@Ameerah Muhammad I know... I've seen it all over YouTube and it pisses me off
Monz,56:54,It’s about the equality for poc
Teri Birrell,56:58,"What I don’t understand is how that cop had EIGHTEEN complaints against him, including what 4?! deaths and two letters of reprimand and he was STILL working?!? How??"
Julie,56:58,"Here is the thing, The situation is horrible. But this is absolutely bringing attention and awareness to people who need to hear it. Who have to understand."
IndigobluBeauty,56:59,At this point I’m not explaining Black lives matter...everyone should know this 🙄
Jennifer Ruiz,57:03,@Chris Leeds assume im white.. people here even questioned my ethnicity and if im a poc.. its straight ignorance.. if that mattered to me i wouldve been in a grave from stress.. i dont have to prove
MzzVixen,57:04,"so the cop's wife is now divorcing him, because of what he did, I wonder how those type of police would change if every night their mom, dad, spouse and kids watched their bodycam each night,"
Marisa Irven,57:05,Wow I love how she explained that!
MelliLynn nnn,57:12,PERFECTLY SAID!!!
Julie,57:18,excellent!

Katie Stevens,57:27,Aisha sorry for your loss
Nancy Howell,57:31,Does anyone remember a couple years ago when police were called over complaints of picnicking while black? The women who called the cops were flat out crazy!
Jennifer Giaramita,57:34,"We've forgotten in this country that we are the employers of police and government. They work for us, not the other way around. Its time to start reminding them of that."
Chris Leeds,57:36,Blue Lives matter movement is the worst
Bri Steinke,57:37,"Exactly. I’ve had to explain it so many times, I’m so glad you’re bringing this up, Jen! 🙌🏼"
Mary Murphy,57:40,Aisha Im so sorry
Ameerah Muhammad,57:43,@Teri Birrell because cops protect their own and that’s EXACTLY the problem.
Jennifer Ruiz,57:44,@Chris Leeds that to anyone. even if people believe i owe them that.. i dont.. i know who i am.. period.
Jennifer Gould,57:48,Arianna Grande copied that in text form on her IG
Banshee Muse,57:53,"To all the people that hate the Police, what are tou going to do when you are attacked? you are not going to call Ghostbusters"
Eliane A,57:55,All lives don’t matter UNTIL black lives matter
Mandy S.,57:55,"If your reaction to someone else's struggle is to think of how you shout about your struggle even louder to drown them out, you need to evaluate your empathy levels."

Tiffany Sollog,58:27,Jen... you and Smokey Glow.... champions of injustice in the beauty sphere.
Jessica Barone,58:32,White people scream all lives matter when they are confronting their privilege. That is white fragility. They feel oppressed (🙄) and need a battle cry (🤬)
cc84ist,58:38,too much stuff going on in a matter of days
JennEwithNoY,58:41,the cop that was arrested doesn't even look like the cop in the video!!!
Sarojin Abhi,58:47,"I've seen one person on my social media publicly embrace BLM and apologize for arguing about it in the past, sadly I think he's the only person I know who will change their mind."

Monz,59:03,That’s what I did - I reached out to my black friend to ask what I can do
Heather Rubino,59:03,disagree
Ameerah Muhammad,59:07,@Banshee Muse your comment reeks of privilege. Because black people dont call the police. We have been TRAINED to not do so because we dont trust them.
Mandy S.,59:07,"banshee, the point is that if black people in this country don't feel like the police are there to protect them then something in the police system needs to change."
PenniePlatinum,59:11,Mayra L - thank you for pointing that out.
Mayra L,59:18,Very well said @JenUnboxed
Erin McManaway,59:18,Also fighting for black people and those who are discriminated against the most tends to filter up and end up creating a better environment for all people of color.
Tiffany PK,59:19,"@mzzVixen yeah, I wonder how much of it is hidden and then they get to unleash it on some unsuspecting person."
Marti Hurford,59:25,Mandy S. Perfectly said. 👍🏻
Talestra,59:29,"Sometimes we do though. Sometimes we have to say ""what are you doing? you don't treat people like that!"""
Karen Smith,59:33,@Banshee Muse no one hates police. We hate that problematic police officers are not being corrected.
Eliza Moeller,59:34,"As white women, it's easy to condemn Amy Cooper, but can we also see ourselves in her? When and where do we as white women act like we own space? If we can see that, we can be better allies."
Unapologetically Mocha,59:38,Need is the right word. No group has ever achieved any level of equality without allies.
Nikki Crayons,59:38,"when you say we rise, i stand."
Mel,59:42,I love you Jen for talking about this issue. We all need to use our voice to speak up and get uncomfortable!
Angie Rice,59:44,blue lives matter is ridiculous. they weren't born cops.
Katherine Kempton,59:46,"We don't hate police, we hate the militaristic culture of policing."
Mandy S.,59:49,just because i'm white and i could call them to protect me doesn't mean i get to turn a blind eye toward the fact that people of color can't count on the same. it's a broken system either way.
Phyrra Nyx,59:50,Until the 'good police' stand up and turn in the 'bad police' there are no good police.
Lori Hikiji,59:51,Absolutely Jen! Judging people as a group is wrong.
Heather Rubino,59:53,We have to use our voice...
Chris Leeds,59:55,@Jennifer Ruiz agreed. We are who we are. we can't help our color. our voices are valid. In some ways... living the life of both gives a prospective that most dont understand. privilege on the outside

Marisa Irven,1:00:20,POC just know cops won’t always help. Sometimes it is what it is and that’s the injustice that’s being protested.
Heather Rubino,1:00:21,as White women! we can't wait anymore to speak out against this. we need to stand with our sisters and brothers... not behind them
Julie,1:00:23,But is disproportionately people of color who are getting brutalized by cops
Bridget White,1:00:31,I am so inspired to see that we are not standing for the injustice and are doing something about it.

Mayra L,1:00:45,Police brutality and arrest is VASTLY disproportionate agains my black and brown people. That’s statistic.
Mandy S.,1:00:46,"i saw a post the other day that says if you have 10 bad cops and 1000 good cops that don't speak up about the bad ones, then you have 1010 bad cops."

Jennifer Gould,1:00:53,@Heather Rubino well said
She_wears_ Dip,1:01:02,whilst all lives do matter in general. this time right now is for black people. to say all lives matter means that black lives matter too which we know isn't true
sketching by aarav,1:01:02,can you answer me please
Erin McManaway,1:01:03,If you have 10 cops who are bad and 1000 cops who ignore the behavior of those bad cops. You have 1010 bad cops
Heidi Hackbarth,1:01:03,I really liked that! which Twitter account is that Jen?

Mayra L,1:01:54,Oh my heart.
Adilya E,1:01:58,Life of privilege explained and $100 raise is a YouTube video that I used to explain this to my teenage son. I think it breaks it down in such a wonderfully understandable way. Try it out!
